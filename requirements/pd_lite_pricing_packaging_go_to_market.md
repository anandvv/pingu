# PD Lite – Pricing, Packaging & Go-To-Market (v1)

## Purpose

This document defines how PD Lite is packaged, priced, and taken to market as an independent startup. The goal is to align pricing with customer value, enable frictionless adoption, and support efficient growth from early-stage teams to large enterprises.

Pricing is a growth lever, not a billing artifact.

## Pricing Philosophy

1. Customers pay for outcomes, not seats
2. Pricing scales with real usage and value delivered
3. Entry must be easy; expansion must be natural
4. Costs must remain predictable
5. AI usage should feel like leverage, not tax

---

## Core Value Units

PD Lite pricing is based on four primary consumption units:

### 1. Incidents Managed

- An incident counts when declared and closed
- Includes full lifecycle management
- Aligns directly with customer value

---

### 2. Notifications Delivered

- Voice, SMS, RCS, WhatsApp, push, and email
- Billed on successful delivery attempts
- Provider redundancy included

---

### 3. AI Actions Executed

- AI-generated summaries
- Classification and recommendations
- Post-incident review drafts

AI actions are metered but bundled generously to encourage adoption.
